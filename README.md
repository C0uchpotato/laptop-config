Dependancies
---
[pacmanfile](https://github.com/cloudlena/pacmanfile) <br />
[dotbot](https://github.com/anishathalye/dotbot) (included in git repo)


Usage
---
Update.sh - dumps all current programs to "pacmanfile-dump.txt" <br />
**Warning: This will overwrite your current program list**

install.sh - this moves all configs from the config locations to your machine and installs all programs listed in pacmanfile-dump.txt <br />
**Warning: Force is enabled by default, this will overwrite your current configs (as is my current preference)** <br />
It is possible to edit pacmanfile-dump.txt by hand, just ensure that the names used are the actual package names in the AUR or Arch repos <br />
